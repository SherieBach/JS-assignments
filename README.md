# JS-assignments
We've started the JS COURSE week 8 this year and will be exploring JS throughout the semester. 
I'll be adding jQuery, jQ UI, TS Angular, REACT and much more. 
Theses are only my small assignments which includes different libraries and framework. Be gentle.

If you just happen to be here, I wouldn't mind getting some advice or recommendations if you have some. :)
